**üöÄ Data processing and database updating tool!**

**Data Processor** is a Python script that streamlines the process of updating database records from external data files. While designed for a specific use case, it serves as an excellent model for building similar tools for your company's data management needs.

## üéØ Key Features

- **üìà Processes structured data files**
- **üîç Validates data** before database operations
- **üóÉÔ∏è Performs database operations** based on input data
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Robust error handling** and reporting
- **üìä Real-time progress tracking** with GUI
- **üßµ Multi-threaded processing** for improved performance

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites

- **Python** 3.7 or higher
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `pyodbc`, `tkinter`, `tkinterdnd2`
- Access to the target database

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the script:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/data-processor.git
   cd data-processor
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas pyodbc tkinterdnd2
   ```

3. Update the database connection string in the script with your details.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Script

Execute the script in Python:

```bash
python data_processor.py
```

## üí° How It Works

1. The script provides a GUI for selecting an input file.
2. It reads the file and validates the data.
3. The data is then processed in two phases:
   - Test phase: Checks data validity without making changes.
   - Process phase: Performs database operations with the input data.
4. Progress is displayed in real-time via the GUI.
5. Results, including successes and errors, are shown in the GUI and saved to a log file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

- The script is designed to work with a specific database structure and input file format.
- Modify the data validation and processing logic to fit your specific needs.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Sensitive Information

This public version has had sensitive information such as server addresses, database names, and credentials removed. When adapting this script for your use, ensure to replace these with your actual connection details.
